# Smart-waste-collection
A real-time system to monitor garbage collection, optimize collection routes, and ensure governance and performance


# ♻️ Smart Waste Collection & Optimization Platform

## 🚀 Overview
The **Smart Waste Collection & Optimization Platform** is a real-time data engineering project built on **Databricks**, **Delta Live Tables**, **Azure Data Factory**, and **Unity Catalog**. It ingests sensor data from smart bins, processes it in real time, and provides actionable insights to optimize waste collection routes and reduce operational costs.

---

## 📊 Key Features

- 🔄 **Real-time data ingestion** from IoT-enabled waste bins
- 📈 **Delta Live Tables (DLT)** pipelines for scalable streaming and batch transformations
- 🧠 **Predictive analytics** for overflow detection and route planning
- 🛡️ **Data governance** with Unity Catalog for secure and compliant data access
- ⚙️ **CI/CD integration** using Databricks Asset Bundles for automated deployment
- 🗺️ **Dashboards and alerting** for supervisors and city planners

⚙️ How to Run
✅ Prerequisites
Azure subscription with ADF and Databricks workspace

Unity Catalog enabled on your Databricks workspace

IoT data simulator or Event Hub with live data stream

🚀 Steps
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-waste-optimization.git
cd smart-waste-optimization
Deploy ingestion pipelines using Azure Data Factory or Event Hubs.

Open the Databricks workspace and import notebooks from the /notebooks directory.

Deploy the Delta Live Tables pipeline using the config in /dlt_pipelines.

Set up governance policies as described in /governance/unity_catalog_config.md.

Launch dashboards from /dashboards to view real-time bin statuses.

📌 Example Use Cases
🚛 Smart City Waste Management

🏫 University Campus Bin Monitoring

🏙️ Commercial Real Estate Facilities

📈 Future Enhancements
Integrate route optimization APIs (e.g., Google Maps, GraphHopper)

Add predictive ML model for bin overflow

Integrate weather and event data for more accurate planning

Mobile alert system for field crews
